# Objectives 
This project aims to analyze and clean an existing dataset called Patient Survival Prediction. This dataset includes a patients basic information like their Age, BMI, weight and their vitals when they get admitted to the hospital. It also includes health and sickness information like if a patient is responsive, if they have known diseases that could contribute to their increased mortality rate. This also aims to figure out which features play the biggest role when it comes to identifying a patients mortality. After the identification of these features, we create, use and tune different classification models that produces the best recall score. We are focusing on recall in this dataset
